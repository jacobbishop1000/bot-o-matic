#HOW TO RUN BOT-O-MAT
This application was written in Java using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. However, all the extra files created by the IDE aren't necessary.
The only three files needed should be Bot.java, main.java, and Task.java
The main.java class should be run to start the console-based program. Once started, the user will only interact with the console to navigate the program.

# BOT-O-MAT
Application should collect a name and robot type from the types we list below. For each, it should create a Robot of the type the user chooses, e.g. Larry, Bipedal. 

Given the list of tasks below, application should then assign the Robot a set of five tasks, all of which complete after a duration that we show in milliseconds. 



- Collect a name and robot type from user.
- Instantiate a Robot of the type provided by the user with the name provided by the user
  - for example: Bipedal, Larry
- Set up methods on Robot to complete tasks from the provided list

## Robot
Robot completes tasks and removes them from the list when they are done (i.e. enough time has passed since starting the task).

## Tasks
Tasks have a description and an estimated time to complete.
